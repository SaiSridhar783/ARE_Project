## Applied Rock Engineering Project

This program allows you to find the parameters of rock mass based on the latest reasearch of Hoek and Brown.

You can compare the values in presence and absence of confining stress.

_The program was built using Nextron (NextJS integrated into electron) and has been compiled for windows and linux operating systems._
